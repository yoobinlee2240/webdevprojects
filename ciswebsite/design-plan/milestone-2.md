# Group Project, Milestone 2: Design Journey

[← Table of Contents](design-journey.md)


## Milestone 1 Feedback Revisions
> Explain what you revised in response to the Milestone 1 feedback (1-2 sentences)
> If you didn't make any revisions, explain why.

Based on the feedback we received from Milestone 1, we decided that no revisions were necessary.

## Content Organization
> Document your card sorting here.
> Include photographic evidence of card sorting **and** description of your thought process. (1-2 sentences)
> Please physically sort cards; please don't do this digitally.

![first iteration of cardsort](group-cardsort-1.jpeg)
For this iteration, we took the content from our planned content section from Mileston 1 and tried to group them into categories based on relation and approachability.

![second iteration of cardsort](group-cardsort-2.jpeg)
After our first iteration, we decided that we should add another group for concentrations because we decided that we would want separate pages for each concentration to make finding information as accessible as possible.


## Final Content Organization
> Which iteration of card sorting will you use for your website? (1 sentence)

We plan to use the second iteration of our card sort, which includes five groupings for our planned content.

> Explain how the final organization of content is appropriate for your site's audiences. (1-2 sentences)

The final organization of content makes sense for ISST majors by reflecting their need for quick, efficient access to key resources. Grouping content into clear categories, such as concentrations and program-specific information, helps them easily find the details they need to navigate their academic path.


## Navigation
> Please list the pages you will include in your website's navigation.

- Home
- Programs
- Degree Planning
- Concentrations
- Help

> Explain why the names of these pages make sense for your site's audience. (1-2 sentences)

The page names are straightforward and easy to understand. They match what ISST majors are likely looking for, like information about programs, concentrations, planning their degree, or getting help with academic or career-related questions.

## Example Website 1

<https://www.cs.stanford.edu/>

![Stanford Website](StanfordCS.png)

- What **goals** do you think the audience likely has when visiting this site.
    Visitors likely would want to learn about the department’s academic programs, courses, requirements, research initiatives, and faculty members. They may also look for information on admissions, events, or opportunities to engage with the department.

- What do you like about the design?

    The design is clean and intuitive, with a well-organized navigation bar for wide screens and hamburger icon for narrow which makes it easy to access important information. The inclusion of a search bar is interesting as well.


## Example Website 2

<https://www.media.mit.edu/>

![MIT Media Lab Website](MediaMIT.png)

- What **goals** do you think the audience likely has when visiting this site.

    Visitors of this site likely want to stay informed regarding news and updates about the MIT media lab, learn more about its research, find and connect with people associated with the MIT media lab, or more generally, learn the purpose and mission of the MIT lab.

- What do you like about the design?

    I appreciate how the website uses a responsive design that dynamically adjusts its layout as visitors scroll through the pages. Additionally, the website features smooth transitions and adaptability to various screen sizes.


## Interactivity Brainstorm
> Using the audience goals you identified, brainstorm possible options for interactivity to enhance the functionality
> of the site while also assisting the audience with their goals.
> Briefly explain idea each idea and provide a brief rationale for how the interactivity enhances the site's
> functionality for the audience.
> Note: You may find it easier to sketch for brainstorming. That's fine too.

- Interactivity idea 1: Dropdown menu for each page on the navigation that allows the user to be directed to a specific section of a page based on what information they are looking for. We think that this could help streamline the process of obtaining information rather than having to scroll through each page to look for the specific information of interest.
- Interactivity idea 2: Dropdown navigation on the sidebar that allows the user to always be able to see the navigation at all times. This allows for visual accessibility of the information that is available on the website. Having the navigation available on the sidebar could allow the user to get more familiar with what information is availble.
- Interactivity idea 3: Hamburger menu on a narrow screen. This is a design that is familiar to users and allows for more visual space when the navigation is closed. Utilizing a familiar design will allow users to navigate through the page with ease.


## Design Exploration
> Iterate on your site's design through sketching.
> Sketch both the narrow and wide versions of the site.
> Here you are just exploring your layout ideas. You don't need to sketch every page.
> Include some of your interactivity ideas in your sketches.
> Provide an explanation for each sketch explaining the idea and the design patterns you are leveraging.

![first iteration of narrow sketch](narrow-home-sketch1.png)
This narrow design features a clean header with a logo, site title, and a hamburger menu for navigation. A large hero image and welcome message create a clear visual hierarchy, followed by scrollable content and a footer for consistency. It maintains a professional and user-friendly experience with consistent branding and interactivity.


![first iteration of wide sketch](horiz-home-sketch-1.jpg)
Using our card sort, we knew that we would have "four pages" representing each grouping of content. We thought these would be most accessible through the header. We took inspiration from MIT Media Lab with a side bar on the left side and the main home content next to it. Within the navigation in the header, we have an interactive component where the user can click on a specific section of the page based on what they are looking for. We sketched this interactivity as we thought it would make accessing information more efficient and straightforward.


![second iteration of wide sketch](horiz-home-sketch-2.jpg)
This wide screen design has a top navigation bar with clear links to other web pages, a central image, and a welcome section for visual hierarchy. The header and navigation bar creates contrast. An interactive modal within the image enhances engagement, while an aside element on the right organizes supplementary content. The footer ensures consistent navigation and branding.


![second iteration of narrow sketch pt.1](narrow2-1.png)
![second iteration of narrow sketch pt.2](narrow2-2.png)
This design draws inspiration from the MIT Media Lab site, with large images that fill the screen and engage the user. We make use of a hamburger button in the top right corner that will open a hamburger menu using JavaScript.

## Design Rationale
> Explain why your design is appropriate for your audience.
> Specifically, why does your content organization, navigation, and site design/layout meet the goals of your users?
> How did you employ **design patterns** to improve the familiarity of the site for your audience?

Our design is appropriate for our audience - ISST majors. We focused on simplicity and clarity in content organization which enables users to quickly locate the information they need. The navigation is both intuitive and logical. To create a sense of familiarity, we followed traditional layout conventions from peer websites that our audience is familiar with, while incorporating the provided branding guidelines, such as colors and fonts. Additionaly, we implemented well-established design patterns, such as a clear visual hierarchy, consistent use of branding elements, and responsive design. Together, these choices improve usability and ensure the site aligns with the expectations of our target users.


## Interactivity Rationale
> Describe the purpose of your proposed interactivity.
> Provide a brief rationale explaining how your proposed interactivity addresses the goals of your site's audience and enhances their user experience.

We propose a hamburger menu for narrow screens and a dropdown menu for wide screens. On narrow screens, the hamburger menu hides navigation to save space and reveals it when clicked. On wide screens, hovering over menu items shows dropdown content, allowing quick access to specific sections and improving content visibility.
This design enhances user experience by adapting to different screen sizes, providing clean, efficient navigation on both narrow and wide screens, and simplifying content access.
