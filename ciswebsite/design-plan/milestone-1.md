# Group Project, Milestone 1: Design Journey

[← Table of Contents](design-journey.md)


## Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This contract is a _living_ document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

Your team contract should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.

1. To what goals do we all commit?

    Prioritize the client's desires and audience perspective. Communicate effectively and frequently regarding project material and availability.

2. What are our "ground rules"? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

    **Tip:** Interrupting another person can make them feel like their option isn't valued. Consider a rule about interrupting.

    Disagreements are put to a vote with an alternative suggestion. Communicate busy weeks as we understand work will not always be split evenly every waking moment. Communicate when an assigned portion is completed. Check each other's work with good intentions.

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

    We will communicate most frequently via text group chat and we will plan to meet every week in lab based on availability. We will also plan to meet outside when needed.

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

    Communicate via the git discussion forum, ideally at least 24-48 hours before the deadline to ensure our client has ample time to respond with our deadline in mind. Communication with the client will mainly be driven by clarifying questions.

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**No "coder" or "designer" roles are permitted;** everyone must design and code.)

    **Tip:** It's often helpful to think of **responsibilities** rather than roles here.

    We will create the following roles: communication driver (responsible for making sure we are communicating effectively), checker (responsible for checking work before submission with guidelines), submitter (responsible for submitting and filling out form), task liaison (responsible for communicating with others to divide up tasks), client connection (responsible for reaching out to the client to make sure we have a consistent relationship with them)

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

    If a team member appears to be contributing less or hasn’t met their commitments, we’ll ask if they’d be willing to take on a larger portion of the next week’s tasks. First, we’ll check in with them to see how they feel about their current workload, ask about their progress, and see if they need any support. If needed, we can discuss task re-delegation in the group chat. We’ll also refer to the course teamwork rubric to make sure we’re all aligned on expectations.

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

   Everyone shares their plans and reasoning, and then we take a vote. The option with the most votes is the one we go with.

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

   If any part of this contract seems ineffective, we will coordinate a time to meet in person or during lab. Together, we’ll review each section, discuss our thoughts on what’s working and what could be improved, and propose revisions. We’ll ensure everyone has a chance to contribute to the discussion.

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? Maybe you team needs a _fun_ clause...

    **Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!

    After the completion of the project go out and get a treat together.

If we find that there are discrepancies in our contract, we will refer to 8. to revise and revisit.


## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the contract, please email the instructors at <info1300@cornell.edu>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.


## Audience
> Briefly explain your site's audience.

 Our audience is Engineering B.S. in Information Science Systems and Technology (ISST) majors. These students are those who are declared or interested in the Information Science program within the College of Engineering.

> Explain how this audience is the least represented in your group. (1-2 sentences)

Since our team includes one member from each college, we decided to focus on Engineering B.S. in Information Science Systems and Technology majors because while Information Science is offered across different colleges at Cornell, it’s the least represented within the College of Engineering.

## User Interview Planning
> Plan the user interview which you'll use to identify the goals of your site's audience.

**User Interview Briefing & Consent:** Hi, I am a student at Cornell University. I'm currently taking a class on web design and for a project, I am re-designing the website for Information Science majors. I'm trying to learn more about the people that might use this site.

Instead, she googled the Cornell Information Science Minor to take her to the page she needed on the site. When she got on the minor page, she couldn't find where Dyson students went.
4. In which areas or sections of the site did you spend the most time? She spent the most time on the home page of the minor to determine which link she should click based on her being in Dyson.
5. Do you recall any moments when you wanted help or guidance on the site? If so, could you describe the challenges you faced? She needed help seeing which minor requirements she would fall under because Dyson wasn't explicitly written in the minor choices.
6. Did the site feel like it was designed for someone like you, or did it seem more relevant to other groups? If so, could you describe which areas of the site made you feel that way? She found the website hard to navigate and didn't feel as though it was for someone like her. She thinks if it really was designed for someone in mind, it was designed for patient, tech-savvy individuals. She felt this way because the website was difficult to navigate and she thought that the wording was unclear.


**Interviewee 2:**

Female freshman in A&S looking for a major

1. Do you have any connections to the Information Science major? How would you describe your relationship or interest in the field? She doesn't have any connections right now other than knowing people in the major.

   - He found some information on core courses and concentrations, but he had to navigate multiple pages and go back and forth a lot to get a complete picture. More importantly, when he pressed "Admission to Major", he was expecting to see information on the courses he needs to admit to the major, but instead it was a page for officially applying to the major.

4. **In which areas or sections of the site did you spend the most time?**
   - He spent the most time in the Degree Requirements section, focusing on specific courses and concentrations to see if the major was worth pursuing.

5. **Do you recall any moments when you wanted help or guidance on the site? If so, could you describe the challenges you faced?**
   - He said he could have used more guidance on understanding the major as a whole. He had to piece together different parts of the site, which made it hard to visualize a clear path or typical track in ISST. A sample course sequence would have been helpful.

6. **Did the site feel like it was designed for someone like you, or did it seem more relevant to other groups? If so, could you describe which areas of the site made you feel that way?**
   - He felt the site was a bit unhelpful and confusing at times for someone still deciding on the major. He would have liked more information specifically addressing students in his position, such as how the ISST track in Engineering is unique and examples of projects from Engineering students in IS.
