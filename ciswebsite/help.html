      <h2><a id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a></h2>

      <h3>What is the history of the Cornell Information Science undergraduate program?</h3>
      <p>
        The Information Science Program began offering undergraduate majors during the 2003-2004 school year. The first graduates were the Class of 2005. Please see our History page for more information.
      </p>

      <h3>How many majors are there in Information Science and Information Science, Systems, and Technology?</h3>
      <p>
        In the Fall of 2017, there were nearly 300 Info Sci and ISST majors across all three schools. For some context, there were 150 Info Sci majors in Fall 2014.
      </p>

      <h3>How can I be sure that this major is right for me?</h3>
      <p>
        Look over the information about our undergraduate majors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Send a message to CornellUG@infosci.cornell.edu. Using this address you can schedule an appointment with the Undergraduate Coordinator in 110H Gates Hall to ask questions about our majors. She can also put you in touch with current students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Check out the IS careers page to see what jobs and internships are currently being offered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Review some of the Student Profiles to see what our students' experiences have been during their time as Information Science majors at Cornell.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Alumni network is growing and we hope to keep our Alumni pages updated with information about where graduates are working and what they are doing. This can give you a great idea of what InfoSci grads are doing in the real world.
      </p>

      <h3>What is the typical course load, and how many of the major courses are electives?</h3>
      <p>
        The average undergraduate course load is 15 - 18 credits. IS and ISST majors can mainly expect 5-course semesters, and a few 4-course semesters. For more specific information, please browse the requirements for our majors:
      </p>

      <p>
        B.A. in Information Science, College of Arts & Sciences*<br>
        B.S. in Information Science, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences*<br>
        B.S. in Information Science, Systems and Technology, College of Engineering<br>
        *Students in the B.S. and B.A. Information Science majors have the same major requirements. The degree only differs in the requirements for each college. For more information on college requirements, follow these links: College of Arts & Sciences, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, College of Engineering.
      </p>

      <h3>To what extent do the IS major courses offer hands on experience vs. traditional classroom curriculum?</h3>
      <p>
        There are many opportunities for both traditional classroom and project-based learning, depending on the student's interests. Courses for the major range from hands-on design of user interfaces to studying the effects of technology on society as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        We encourage undergraduate research, which typically involves individual project work with a faculty member or research scientist.
      </p>

      <h3>What kind of materials and technologies are utilized in the IS major courses?</h3>
      <p>
        Mainly computer-based systems, including human-computer interaction, visual medias, text-based analysis, and all forms of data and knowledge based decision systems.
      </p>

      <h3>How many students are in a typical class?</h3>
      <p>
        It varies greatly. Large introductory courses (i.e. a programming class) may have several hundred students. Core courses in the major are smaller, ranging from slightly over 40 to under 10 students.
      </p>

      <h3>What do IS and ISST majors typically do after graduation?</h3>
      <p>
        The premise of the IS program is that many of the interesting problems and questions (and jobs) of the future will be concerned with the interactions between people and information systems. Thus, the undergraduate majors cover both technical issues and social science issues. Many Information Science and Information Science, Systems, and Technology graduates have gone on to careers that involve the design, development, and testing of interactive systems, from Web sites to mobile devices to software, and to leadership roles such as product management. The multi-disciplinary nature of the Information Science program can also prepare students for careers in other fields where expertise in interface design, data managment, and other digital solutions are needed, such as healthcare and law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our major is fairly new, so we don't know exactly what percentage of students will go on to graduate study, however we anticipate that approximately 25% of our graduates will go on to do graduate studies.
      </p>

      <h2><a id="academic-resources">Academic Resources</a></h2>
      <p>
        At times, your first job search can feel like a job in itself. There are résumés to update, portfolios to develop, contacts to make and interviews to nail, and all of this on top of your weekly coursework. Where to begin? The good news is Cornell University touts a wide range of career-development resources across campus to help guide you through each stage of the job hunt, from identifying your particular industry of interest all the way to signing an offer. To help get you started, we’ve included a few of these resources.
      </p>

      <h3>CIS MPS Career webpage</h3>
      <p>
        Start here with Computing and Information Science's dedicated Master of Professional Studies (MPS) career webpage, filled with practical information to help with job-search preparation for all Info Sci students. Find everything you'll need to ready a resume, perfect an elevator pitch, improve a portfolio, and nail job interviews. This great resource also includes helpful information for job-seeking international students.
      </p>

      <h3>CIS Career resources page</h3>
      <p>
        Are you an undergraduate Info Sci student? If so, your home College (Arts & Sciences, CALS, or College of Engineering) each has its own career service staffers and resources to help with your career search, whether it's fine-tuning your portfolio or connecting with other students on campus or alumni in industry.
      </p>

      <h3>Engineering's Career Center</h3>
      <p>
        For Info Sci graduate students, Cornell Engineering leads a robust Career Center staffed with exceptional facilitators to help you in all areas of professional development. And since Cornell Computing and Information Science is housed under the Engineering school, Information Science graduate students are encouraged to take advantage of this great resource. Keep tabs on upcoming career events and webinars and get started on self-guided career tutorials.
      </p>

      <h3>Handshake</h3>
      <p>
        Handshake is the online recruiting platform that Cornell uses to connect employers with our talented students. Through this crucial database, students can view and apply to open positions or internship opportunities and find out which companies are planning a visit to Cornell.
      </p>

      <h3>Student Associations within Info Sci</h3>
      <p>
        Do your career planning some good and join a student association. The Information Science Student Association does student mentoring, corporate recruiting, social meet-ups, and much more. Similar groups like Women in Computing at Cornell (WICC) and Cornell Under-represented Minorities in Computing (URMC) also host corporate events, tech talks, and workshops. Our graduate student network is also strong, with student associations housed in each of Computing and Information Science's three departments.
      </p>

      <h3>Info Sci MPS Facebook group</h3>
      <p>
        MPS students are encouraged to join up with fellow students and alums on this student- and alumni-run Facebook group. Have questions about the curriculum or about living in Ithaca? Connect with the Cornell MPS network here and ask away.
      </p>
