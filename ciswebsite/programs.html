Students take classes in operations research modeling techniques, statistics, computer science, economics, and the social and organizational contexts in which transformative information systems exist.</p>

        <h3>Overview of Major Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Students are required to complete seven core courses. As majors in ISST, students will have to satisfy a sequence of required mathematics courses.</li>
          <li>Once core course requirements have been met, students are required to complete one primary concentration, a secondary concentration, and two major approved electives. Detailed information can be found on the Concentrations page.</li>
          <li>All classes toward the completion of major requirements must be taken for a letter grade.</li>

        <h2><a id="comparison">Major vs. Minor</a></h2>
        <p>Choosing between an Information Science (IS) major and minor depends on your academic goals and career aspirations.</p>

        <h3>Depth of Study</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Major:</strong> Provides a comprehensive understanding of the field. You'll take a core curriculum and delve deeper into a specific concentration area through advanced coursework.</li>
          <li><strong>Minor:</strong> Offers a foundational understanding of IS. You'll take a smaller set of courses, typically focused on a single concentration, but with less depth compared to the major.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Time Commitment</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Major:</strong> Requires a significant time investment, typically taking several semesters to complete.</li>
          <li><strong>Minor:</strong> Can be completed in a shorter timeframe, often within a year or two, depending on the program structure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Choosing the Right Path</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Major:</strong> Ideal if you're passionate about IS and want a career in the field.</li>
          <li><strong>Minor:</strong> Great if you want a basic understanding of IS to supplement your primary major or explore the field before committing to a full major.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Ultimately, the best choice depends on your individual goals and interests. Consider your academic interests, career aspirations, and course load capacity when making your decision.</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li>The IS minor is self-guided.</li>
          <li>The very large demand for our courses among CIS majors (CS, IS, Stats) means that we cannot guarantee access to our upper-level courses for students pursuing the IS minor.</li>
          <li>No class enrollment priority is given to students pursuing the IS minor.</li>
          <li>No class substitutions are allowed in the IS minor.</li>
          <li>No transfer or study abroad credits are accepted for the IS minor.</li>
          <li>Limited advising is available for students pursuing the IS minor</li>
          <li>Please note that a letter grade of C or better is required for all classes counting toward the minor; S/U courses are not allowed.</li>
