# Project 3, Final Submission: Design Journey

[← Table of Contents](design-journey.md)


> **Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)
>
> Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.
>
> Place all design journey images inside the "design-plan" folder and then link them in Markdown so that they are visible in Markdown Preview.
>
> **Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Milestone 1 Feedback Revisions
> Explain what you revised in response to the Milestone 1 feedback (1-2 sentences)
> If you didn't make any revisions, explain why.

I added html and css files from Project 2.


## Interactivity Usability Justification
> Explain how the interactivity _functionally_ improves the user's experience and helps them accomplish their goals. (i.e. Your interactivity does _more_ than add additional clicks; the interactivity doesn't insert additional barriers for the user when working towards their goals.)
> Explain how your interactivity's design effectively uses affordances, visibility, feedback, and familiarity.
> Write a paragraph (3-4 sentences)

My hamburger menu and map modal improve user experience by simplifying navigation and providing quick access to essential information. The hamburger menu reduces clutter and uses familiar affordances, like the three-line icon, for easy recognition. The map modal offers clear feedback and intuitive controls, allowing users to focus on location-specific tasks efficiently. Both features enhance usability without adding unnecessary barriers, helping users achieve their goals smoothly.


## Tell Us What to Grade
> We aren't re-grading your entire Project 1 or 2.
> We are only grading the interactivity you added to the project.
> Tell us where (what pages) we can find your interactivity and how to use it.
> **We will only grade what you list here;** if it's not listed here, we won't grade it. **No exceptions.**

Hamburger menu: click the three line button to open the hamburger menu on the navigation on every/any narrow web pages
Modal: On the Shop page, click the round button at the right bottom corner to open the map modal


## Self-Reflection
> Reflect on what you learned during this assignment. How have you improved from Project 1? What would you do differently next time? (2-3 sentences)

I learned how to integrate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive, interactive website, which was a significant improvement from Project 1. Next time, I would experiment with different types of modals to explore more design and functionality options.


> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments! (1-3 sentences)

I'm proud of how much I've learned, especially in implementing a fully functional website and troubleshooting on my own. This milestone challenged me to work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together, which helped me improve my problem-solving skills and confidence in debugging issues independently.
