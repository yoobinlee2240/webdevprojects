# Project 3: Design Journey

For each milestone, complete only the design journey file for that milestone.

If you need to revise your design/plan, please revise the plan in the original milestone file.
When updating, do **not** delete your original plan. Leave your original plan in place and append to it. Place your new plan _below_ the original and then explain why you are changing your plan.
