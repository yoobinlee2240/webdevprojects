    Hi! I am <strong>Yoobin</strong> from the DC Metropolitan area in Northern Virginia. I am a sophomore at <strong>Cornell University</strong>, studying <strong>Urban and Regional Studies</strong> and <strong>Information Science</strong> with a concentration in UX design. The areas I'm interested in include GIS, Web Development, UI/UX Design, and Social Justice.
  </p>

  <h3>My mission</h3>
  <p>I hope to be able to utilize my design and GIS skills to make positive impacts on my communities.</p>

  <h3>My Journey</h3>
  <p>I was born and raised in South Korea and moved to Virginia with my family in 9th grade. I attended a specialized high school to study graphic communications for two years, where I completed graphic design projects and print production orders for county governments, schools, businesses, and organizations using Adobe Creative Suite and professional printing equipment. At Cornell, I've been involved in various student organizations as a designer, continuing my journey as a designer.</p>

  <h3>Outside of School/Work</h3>
  <p>In my free time, I enjoy biking around my neighborhood, discovering new spots, and dining hall hopping with my roommate. We document our food adventures on our Instagram page.</p>
