**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

Place all design journey images inside the "design-plan" folder and then link them in Markdown so that they are visible in Markdown Preview.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Markdown Instructions

My website will be about my professional development and career journey that serves as a portfolio.


## Personal Website Design Exploration

Identify two personal websites (preferably static websites) that exist today on the web. You will be drawing inspiration from these sites for your own site; **please select websites that are similar to the website you wish to create**. You may not use the instructor's website or template websites for this part; the example websites should be real personal websites that exist on the web.

Include a **mobile** screenshot of the home page for each site. (If you're taking a screenshot on your laptop, resize your browser window to a mobile size before taking the screenshot.)

**We'll refer to these are your "example websites."**
